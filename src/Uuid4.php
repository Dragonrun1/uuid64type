    /**
     * Custom base 64 encoding of UUID v4 (random).
     *
     * Expected use will be in Doctrine entities instead of using auto-increment IDs.
     *
     * A UUID is 128-bits long in binary so most programming language can only
     * support it in some kind of string or integer array format. Most commonly
     * a binary string is used for compactness where strings can contain (nul)
     * chars. This format is rarely seen except in functions were the UUID is
     * being created as it's hard for programmers to work with since can't be
     * visualized easily. The normal formatted string version with 36
     * characters or as a hexadecimal string with 32 characters are much more
     * commonly used. Both of these formats trade off two times or more memory
     * use to make them easier to work with. By using a base 64 encoding it will
     * increases the memory usage by less than 40 percent (22 chars) over a
     * binary string (16 chars).
     *
     * So in summary these are the benefits to using this custom base 64 encoded
     * format:
     *
     *   * Database compatible - Can be directly stored in any of VARCHAR,
     *     CHAR, BINARY, etc field types.
     *   * URL compatible - Doesn't contain any chars that require special
     *     escaping in URLs.
     *   * HTML compatible - Doesn't include any special chars that need to be
     *     escaped when used in html forms or tag property values. HTML 5
     *     relaxed the rule that required the id's property value have to start
     *     with a letter.
     *   * More Human readable - Base 64 being shorter that other formats
     *     generally make it more readable to most people.
     *   * Best memory to speed trade-off - The binary string takes up the
     *     least memory but it needs to be converted to and from other formats
     *     when using it in URLs etc. which can cause un-needed server load
     *     issues. The normal and hexadecimal forms are both longer which adds
     *     to both memory and server load issues.
     *
     * @param string|null $data Should normally be `null` to create a truly
     *                          random v4 UUID.
     *
     * @return string Returns custom base 64 encoded UUID v4 as string.
     * @throws \Exception Throws an Exception if it was not possible to gather
     * sufficient entropy in random_bytes().
